**Self-Balancing Bot Project**
---
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Self-Balancing Bot project! This repository contains the code for calibration and achieving self-balancing functionality using an MPU6050, Arduino Uno, 2 BO Motors, and an L298N Motor Driver.

*Project Overview*:
---

**Key Components:**

-**MPU6050**: Gyroscope and accelerometer for accurate motion sensing.
-**Arduino Uno**: The brain of the operation, executing the self-balancing algorithm.
-**BO Motors**: Responsible for the movement and balance of the bot.
-**L298N Motor Driver**: Facilitates motor control and ensures smooth operation.

**Calibration:**

The calibration code ensures precise sensor readings from the MPU6050, allowing for accurate data interpretation during the self-balancing process.

**Self-Balancing Algorithm:**

The main code implements a custom self-balancing algorithm, utilizing PID control and efficient I2C communication. The algorithm is designed to optimize the performance of the bot, providing stability and responsiveness.

*How to Use:*
---
**Calibration:**

-Upload the calibration code to the Arduino Uno.

-Follow the provided instructions for accurate sensor calibration.

**Self-Balancing:**

-Upload the self-balancing algorithm code to the Arduino Uno.

-Connect the bot to the specified components.

-Power on the system and watch your self-balancing bot in action!
